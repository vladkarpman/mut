I need to test the recently implemented features in the `mut` CLI tool. Here's what was built:

## Features to Test

### 1. Enhanced Actions (in executor)
- `scroll_to` - Scrolls until element is visible (supports `direction`, `max_scrolls`)
- `long_press` - Long press with configurable `duration` (milliseconds)

### 2. Conditionals (in executor)
- `if_present` - Execute `then` branch if element exists
- `if_absent` - Execute `then` branch if element doesn't exist
- `if_screen` - Execute `then` branch if AI verifies screen matches description
- All support `else` branch and nesting

### 3. Interactive HTML Reports
- Dark theme matching approval flow design
- Before/After screenshots for each step
- Video player with step markers (when video exists)
- Filter by status (All/Passed/Failed/Skipped)
- JSON export button
- Keyboard navigation

## Test Commands

```bash
# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run all unit tests first
pytest -v

# Then manual testing with a real device
mut devices  # Verify device connected

# Create and run test with new features
mut run tests/demo/test.yaml

# Open the generated HTML report
open tests/demo/reports/*/report.html
```

## What I Want You To Do

1. Run the unit tests and confirm they pass
2. Help me create test YAML files that exercise the new features
3. Run the tests on my connected Android device
4. Verify the HTML reports generate correctly and look right
5. Report any bugs or issues found

## Example Test File (tests/demo/test.yaml)

```yaml
config:
  app: com.google.android.calculator

steps:
  - launch_app
  - wait: 2s

  # Test long_press
  - long_press: "5"
    duration: 1000

  # Test conditionals
  - if_present: "AC"
    then:
      - tap: "AC"

  - tap: "1"
  - tap: "+"
  - tap: "2"
  - tap: "="

  - verify_screen: "Calculator showing result 3"

  - terminate_app
```

## Key Files

- Executor: `mutcli/core/executor.py` (scroll_to, long_press, conditionals)
- Report template: `mutcli/templates/report.html`
- Report generator: `mutcli/core/report.py`
- Tests: `tests/test_executor.py`, `tests/test_report.py`
